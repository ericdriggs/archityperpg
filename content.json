        "content": "\"God also likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside God, He has no one but himself to play with. But He gets over this difficulty by pretending that He is not Himself. This is His way of hiding from Himself. He pretends that He is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, all the plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way He has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when He wakes up they will disappear.\n\nNow when God plays hide and pretends that He is you and I, He does it so well that it takes Him a long time to remember where and how He hid Himself. But that’s the whole fun of it – just what He wanted to do. He doesn’t want to find Himself out too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be Himself. But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self – the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever....\n\nYou may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain. Remember, first, that He isn’t really doing this to anyone but Himself. Remember, too, that in almost all the stories you enjoy there have to be bad people as well as good people, for the thrill of the tale is to find out how the good people will get the better of the bad. It’s the same as when we play cards. At the beginning of the game we shuffle them all into a mess, which is like the bad things in the world, but the point of the game is to put the mess into good order, and the one who does it best is the winner. Then we shuffle the cards once more and play again, and so it goes with the world.\"\n\n― Alan Watts, What to tell children about God"

        "content": "###The law of Paradox\n\n\"There was once a philosophy professor who opened each class by reminding his students that the true test of any philosophical belief is whether that belief is itself paradoxical. This is a difficult concept to grasp, so one of his students approached a math professor and asked if he could explain this puzzling teaching. The math professor came to the next class, and as the philosophy professor was about to being, stood and asked.\n'Sir, do you really believe that all truth is based on paradox?'\nThe philosophy professor scratched his head and thoughtfully answered.\n'Well, yes...and no.'\"\n\n―  Alan Lurie, Five Minutes on Mondays p. 99\n\nA paradox is a statement that may be true, false or both. In its apparent contradiction it may reveal a  debate of alternate perspectives leading to deeper understanding. The truth which leads to victory is often revealed only through the inner struggles to make sense of paradox. \n\nOne of the most effective ways to add depth to a character is to define one or more paradoxes they believe in.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Watchman character Ozymandias believes the only way to save humanity from bombing itself into extinction is by blowing up New York city. He is fighting fire with fire. Depending on the perspective chosen, he is villain, hero, or both.\n\n\nBatman's goal is to protect innocent lives in Gotham, but his actions result in the creation of many of the super-villains which threaten innocents. Furthermore, his moral code prevents him from killing the Joker, even though this may save many innocent lives.\n\n",

The concept of the archetype, which is an indispensable correlate of the idea of the collective unconscious, indicates the existence of definite forms in the psyche which seem to be present always and everywhere. Mythological research calls them 'motifs'; in the psychology of primitives they correspond to Levy-Bruhl's concept of \"representations collectives,\" and in the field of comparative religion they have been defined by Hubert and Mauss as 'categories of the imagination'... My thesis, then, is as follows: In addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix), there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals.\n\nJung, The Archetypes and the Collective Unconsious"

Shapes looming outside our Platonic cave. We naturally believe ourselves clever and wise, so advanced, and those who came before us so naïve and simple…when all we truly do is echo the order of the universe, as it guides us…\"\nAuthor: Guillermo Del Toro\n\nArchetypes are the primitive constructs of the unconscious mind.

        "content": "###Jungian Archetypes\n\n\"The term \"archetype\" has its origins in ancient Greek. The root words are archein, which means \"original or old\"; and typos, which means \"pattern, model or type\". The combined meaning is an \"original pattern\" of which all other similar persons, objects, or concepts are derived, copied, modeled, or emulated. \n\nThe psychologist, Carl Gustav Jung, used the concept of archetype in his theory of the human psyche. He believed that universal, mythic characters—archetypes—reside within the collective unconscious of people the world over. Archetypes represent fundamental human motifs of our experience as we evolved; consequentially, they evoke deep emotions. \n\nAlthough there are many different archetypes, Jung defined twelve primary types that symbolize basic human motivations. Each type has its own set of values, meanings and personality traits. Also, the twelve types are divided into three sets of four, namely Ego, Soul and Self. The types in each set share a common driving source, for example types within the Ego set are driven to fulfill ego-defined agendas. \n\nMost, if not all, people have several archetypes at play in their personality construct; however, one archetype tends to dominate the personality in general. It can be helpful to know which archetypes are at play in oneself and others, especially loved ones, friends and co-workers, in order to gain personal insight into behaviors and motivations.\"\n\nCarl Golden, The Twelve Archetypes\n\n",

I have called this substratum the collective unconscious. This unconscious psyche, common to all mankind, does not consist merely of contents capable of becoming conscious, but of latent dispositions towards certain identical reactions. Thus the fact of the collective unconscious is simply the psychic expression of the identity of brain-structure irrespective of all racial differences. This explains the analogy, sometimes even identity, between various myth-motifs, and symbols, and the possibility of human beings making themselves mutually understood. The various lines of psychic development start from one common stock whose roots reach back into all the strata of the past. This also explains the psychological parallelisms with animals.\n\nTaken purely psychologically, it means that mankind has common instincts of\nimagination and of action. All conscious imagination and action have been developed with these unconscious archetypal images as their basis, and always remain bound up with them. This condition ensures a primitive health of the psyche, which, however, immediately becomes lack of adaptation as soon as circumstances arise calling for a higher moral effort. Instincts suffice only for the individual embedded in nature, which, on the whole, remains always the same. An individual who is more guided by unconscious than by conscious choice tends therefore towards marked psychic conservatism. This is the reason the primitive does not change in the course of thousands of years, and it is also the reason why he fears everything strange and unusual. \n\nCarl Jung (From Commentary on the Secret of the Golden Flower.)"

You've got to change the fuses, grab the Christmas ornaments, clean the litter box. To the extent that we keep the basement door sealed, the entire home becomes unstable. The creatures downstairs get louder and the guy upstairs (your ego) tries to cover the noise with neurotic behavior. For some, eventually, the basement door can come right off its hinges and the slimy, primal denizens of the deep can become Scrabble partners. You might call this a nervous breakdown or psychotic break, it doesn't matter.
