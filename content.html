<p>“God also likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside God, He has no one but himself to play with. But He gets over this difficulty by pretending that He is not Himself. This is His way of hiding from Himself. He pretends that He is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, all the plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way He has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when He wakes up they will disappear.</p>
<p>Now when God plays hide and pretends that He is you and I, He does it so well that it takes Him a long time to remember where and how He hid Himself. But that’s the whole fun of it – just what He wanted to do. He doesn’t want to find Himself out too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be Himself. But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self – the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever….</p>
<p>You may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain. Remember, first, that He isn’t really doing this to anyone but Himself. Remember, too, that in almost all the stories you enjoy there have to be bad people as well as good people, for the thrill of the tale is to find out how the good people will get the better of the bad. It’s the same as when we play cards. At the beginning of the game we shuffle them all into a mess, which is like the bad things in the world, but the point of the game is to put the mess into good order, and the one who does it best is the winner. Then we shuffle the cards once more and play again, and so it goes with the world.”</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>“Humans are irrational, messy, contradictory and sometimes self-defeating. They act against each others’ interests, and compete viciously and brutally for limited resources. Instead of acting as one, they form complicated tribes that fight between each other. But humans also possess a high capacity for aspiration, kinship, compassion, and a ridiculous tolerance of adversity. For this reason, they are extremely dangerous and likely to take over a significant part of the galaxy in a very short time. Avoid if at all possible.”</p>
<p>― Tom Scott, Danger Humans</p>
<p>Architype is a table-top RPG where players create interesting stories by cooperating and competing for player and party goals. Its name is a portmanteux of the “architect” and “archetype”.</p>
<p>In Architype, no game master is required. Instead, players are given incentives to create “opportunities” by tempting each others character(s) and placing obstacles in their way. This game is designed to help you explore each the conscious and subconscious motivations of each others’ characters through overcoming obstacles in the pursuit of goals.</p>








<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>


<h3 id="use-what-works">Use what works</h3>
<p>“Nature must not win the game, but she cannot lose. And whenever the conscious mind clings to hard and fast concepts and gets caught in its own rules and regulations - as is unavoidable and of the essence of civilized consciousness - nature pops up with her inescapable demands.”</p>
<p>― Carl Gustav Jung, Alchemical Studies</p>
<p>This manual is meant only as a blueprint. You are still the architect of your experience. Your group may ignore any principles, rules or mechanics which are getting in the way of having fun, or telling a good story.</p>


<h3 id="the-law-of-sacrifice">The law of Sacrifice</h3>
<p>“There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch…. I added, pointing to a FREE LUNCH sign across room, or these drinks would cost half as much. Was reminding her that anything free costs twice as much in long run or turns out worthless.”</p>
<p>― Robert Heinlein, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</p>
<p>Everything has its price. For every strength, you have many more weaknesses. Every achieved goal requires the sacrifice of other goals and opportunities. </p>


<h3 id="the-law-of-opposites">The law of Opposites</h3>
<p>“War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength”</p>
<p>―  George Orwell, 1984</p>
<p>Your character’s weaknesses are as important as her strengths. Strengths give her power, while her weaknesses provide motivations which you and other players can leverage to achieve your character’s personal goals and the party’s goals (in that order).</p>


<h3 id="the-law-of-paradox">The law of Paradox</h3>
<p>“There was once a philosophy professor who opened each class by reminding his students that the true test of any philosophical belief is whether that belief is itself paradoxical. This is a difficult concept to grasp, so one of his students approached a math professor and asked if he could explain this puzzling teaching. The math professor came to the next class, and as the philosophy professor was about to being, stood and asked.<br>‘Sir, do you really believe that all truth is based on paradox?’<br>The philosophy professor scratched his head and thoughtfully answered.<br>‘Well, yes…and no.’”</p>
<p>―  Alan Lurie, Five Minutes on Mondays p. 99</p>
<p>A paradox is a statement that may be true, false or both. In its apparent contradiction it may reveal a  debate of alternate perspectives leading to deeper understanding. The truth which leads to victory is often revealed only through the inner struggles to make sense of paradox. </p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to add depth to a character is to define one or more paradoxes they believe in.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>The Watchman character Ozymandias believes the only way to save humanity from bombing itself into extinction is by blowing up New York city. He is fighting fire with fire. Depending on the perspective chosen, he is villain, hero, or both.</p>
<p>Batman’s goal is to protect innocent lives in Gotham, but his actions result in the creation of many of the super-villains which threaten innocents. Furthermore, his moral code prevents him from killing the Joker, even though this may save many innocent lives.</p>








<h3 id="the-law-of-weaknesses">The law of Weaknesses</h3>
<p>“What makes Superman interesting, then? Two things: his code of ethics and his weakness to kryptonite… we don’t really care why he’s strong. He just is.</p>
<p>But why is he weak to kryptonite? If you ask the common person with some familiarity with Superman, they’ll tell you it’s because kryptonite–this glowing green rock–is a shard from his homeworld, which was destroyed. The kryptonite draws you into the story, gets into who Superman is and where he comes from…. Superman is not his powers. Superman is his weaknesses.”</p>
<p>―  Brandon Sanderson, Sanderson’s Second Law</p>
<p>Compelling characters have weaknesses which contradict their strengths. These weaknesses and contradictions create desire, tension, conflict and motivations.</p>


<h3 id="the-law-of-wonder">The law of Wonder</h3>
<p>“The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon.”<br>― Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings</p>


<h3 id="the-law-of-archetypes">The law of Archetypes</h3>
<p>Whereas the personal unconscious consists for the most part of “complexes”, the content of the collective unconscious is made up essentially of “archetypes”. The concept of the archetype, which is an indispensable correlate of the idea of the collective unconscious, indicates the existence of definite forms in the psyche which seem to be present always and everywhere. Mythological research calls them ‘motifs’; in the psychology of primitives they correspond to Levy-Bruhl’s concept of “representations collectives,” and in the field of comparative religion they have been defined by Hubert and Mauss as ‘categories of the imagination’… My thesis, then, is as follows: In addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix), there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals.</p>
<p>Jung, The Archetypes and the Collective Unconsious</p>


<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>


<h3 id="archetypes">Archetypes</h3>
<p> “Any legend, any creature, any symbol we ever stumble on, already exists in a vast cosmic reservoir where archetypes wait. Shapes looming outside our Platonic cave. We naturally believe ourselves clever and wise, so advanced, and those who came before us so naïve and simple…when all we truly do is echo the order of the universe, as it guides us…”<br>Author: Guillermo Del Toro</p>
<p>Archetypes are the primitive constructs of the unconscious mind. Characters exemplify certain archetypes while seeking out complementary and different archetypes.</p>


<h3 id="jungian-archetypes">Jungian Archetypes</h3>
<p>“The term “archetype” has its origins in ancient Greek. The root words are archein, which means “original or old”; and typos, which means “pattern, model or type”. The combined meaning is an “original pattern” of which all other similar persons, objects, or concepts are derived, copied, modeled, or emulated. </p>
<p>The psychologist, Carl Gustav Jung, used the concept of archetype in his theory of the human psyche. He believed that universal, mythic characters—archetypes—reside within the collective unconscious of people the world over. Archetypes represent fundamental human motifs of our experience as we evolved; consequentially, they evoke deep emotions. </p>
<p>Although there are many different archetypes, Jung defined twelve primary types that symbolize basic human motivations. Each type has its own set of values, meanings and personality traits. Also, the twelve types are divided into three sets of four, namely Ego, Soul and Self. The types in each set share a common driving source, for example types within the Ego set are driven to fulfill ego-defined agendas. </p>
<p>Most, if not all, people have several archetypes at play in their personality construct; however, one archetype tends to dominate the personality in general. It can be helpful to know which archetypes are at play in oneself and others, especially loved ones, friends and co-workers, in order to gain personal insight into behaviors and motivations.”</p>
<p>Carl Golden, The Twelve Archetypes</p>

<p>“When you acknowledge the audience’s shadow you become their hero.”<br>― Luis Cubero, Business Storytelling Guide: Creating Business Presentations Using Storytelling Techniques</p>
<p>“The pendulum of the mind alternates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.”</p>
<p>― Jung</p>
<p>“It is also possible for the unconscious or an archetype to take complete possession of a man and to determine his fate down to the smallest detail” </p>
<p>Carl Jung</p>
<p>People are complex. Our unconscious is organized into complexes. Complexes are not necessarily illnesses, they shape our behavior through beliefs and feelings focused on one or more archetypes.</p>

<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>


<p>Whyte</p>


<p>“Vulnerability is not a weakness, a passing indisposition, or something we can arrange to do without. Vulnerability is not a choice. Vulnerability is the underlying, ever-present, and abiding undercurrent of our natural state. To run from vulnerability is to run from the essence of our nature. The attempt to be invulnerable is the vain attempt to become something we are not, and most especially, to close off our understanding of the grief of others. More seriously, in refusing our vulnerability, we refuse the help needed at every turn of our existence and immobilize the essential title and conversational foundations of our identity.”<br>― David Whyte</p>


<p>“The price of our vitality is the sum of all our fears”<br>― David Whyte</p>


<p>“It is not the thing you fear that you must deal with, it is the mother of the thing you fear. The very thing that has given birth to the nightmare.”<br>― David Whyte, The Heart Aroused : Poetry and the Preservation of the Soul in Corporate America</p>


<p>“But then we always knew heaven would be a desperate place. Everything you desired coming in one fearful moment to greet you.”<br>― David Whyte, The Heart Aroused : Poetry and the Preservation of the Soul in Corporate America</p>


<p>“What we have named as anger on the surface is the violent outer response to our own inner powerlessness, a powerlessness connected to such a profound sense of rawness and care that it can find no proper outer body or identity or voice, or way of life to hold it. What we call anger is often simply the unwillingness to live the full measure of our fears or of our not knowing, in the face of our love for a wife, in the depth of our caring for a son, in our wanting the best, in the face of simply being alive and loving those with whom we live.”<br>― David Whyte, Consolations: The Solace, Nourishment and Underlying Meaning of Everyday Words</p>


<p>Jung</p>


<p>People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls. They will practice Indian yoga and all its exercises, observe a strict regimen of diet, learn the literature of the whole world - all because they cannot get on with themselves and have not the slightest faith that anything useful could ever come out of their own souls. Thus the soul has gradually been turned into a Nazareth from which nothing good can come.</p>
<p>Jung, </p>


<p>I have frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life. (Jung [1961] (1989) p. 140)</p>


<p>[Contemporary man] is blind to the fact that, with all his rationality and efficiency, he is possessed by “powers” that are beyond his control. His gods and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names. They keep him on the run with restlessness, vague apprehensions, psychological complications, an insatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food — and, above all, a large array of neuroses. (Jung (1964) p. 82)</p>


<p>Because we cannot discover God’s throne in the sky with a radiotelescope or establish (for certain) that a beloved father or mother is still about in a more or less corporeal form, people assume that such ideas are “not true.” I would rather say that they are not “true” enough, for these are conceptions of a kind that have accompanied human life from prehistoric times, and that still break through into consciousness at any provocation.</p>
<p>Jung</p>


<p>As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.</p>
<p>Jung</p>


<p>The conscious mind allows itself to be trained like a parrot, but the unconscious does not — which is why St. Augustine thanked God for not making him responsible for his dreams.</p>
<p>Jung, Psychology and Alchemy</p>


<p>No one can flatter himself that he is immune to the spirit of his own epoch, or even that he possesses a full understanding of it. Irrespective of our conscious convictions, each one of us, without exception, being a particle of the general mass, is somewhere attached to, colored by, or even undermined by the spirit which goes through the mass. Freedom stretches only as far as the limits of our consciousness.<br>Jung, Paracelsus the Physician (1942)</p>


<p>We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness that we have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions.<br>Jung, The Symbolic Life (1953); also in Man and His Symbols (1964)</p>


<p>The unconscious is not just evil by nature, it is also the source of the highest good: not only dark but also light, not only bestial, semihuman, and demonic but superhuman, spiritual, and, in the classical sense of the word, “divine.”<br>The Practice of Psychotherapy, p. 364 (1953)</p>


<p>If one does not understand a person, one tends to regard him as a fool.<br>Jung, Mysterium Coniunctionis, from The Collected Works of C. G. Jung (1966)</p>


<p>You can take away a man’s gods, but only to give him others in return.<br>Jung, The Undiscovered Self p 63</p>


<p>We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect; we apprehend it just as much by feeling. Therefore, the judgment of the intellect is, at best, only the half of truth, and must, if it be honest, also come to an understanding of its inadequacy.</p>
<p>Jung, The Undiscovered self</p>


<p>The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.</p>
<p>Jung, Modern Man in Search of a Soul</p>


<p>The great decisions of human life have as a rule far more to do with the instincts and other mysterious unconscious factors than with conscious will and well-meaning reasonableness. The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases. Each of us carries his own life-form—an indeterminable form which cannot be superseded by any other.</p>
<p>Jung, Modern Man in Search of a Soul</p>


<p>The meaning and design of a problem seem not to lie in its solution, but in our working at it incessantly.</p>
<p>Jung, Modern Man in Search of a Soul</p>


<p>Every civilized human being, whatever his conscious development, is still an archaic man at the deeper levels of his psyche. Just as the human body connects us with the mammals and displays numerous relics of earlier evolutionary stages going back to even the reptilian age, so the human psyche is likewise a product of evolution which, when followed up to its origins, show countless archaic traits.</p>
<p>Jung, MMISOS</p>


<p>It is sometimes difficult to avoid the impression that there is a sort of foreknowledge of the coming series of events.</p>
<p>Jung</p>


<p>Great talents are the most lovely and often the most dangerous fruits on the tree of humanity. They hang upon the most slender twigs that are easily snapped off.</p>

<p>[…] It must be pointed out that just as the human body shows a common anatomy over and above all racial differences, so, too, the psyche possesses a common substratum transcending all differences in culture and consciousness. I have called this substratum the collective unconscious. This unconscious psyche, common to all mankind, does not consist merely of contents capable of becoming conscious, but of latent dispositions towards certain identical reactions. Thus the fact of the collective unconscious is simply the psychic expression of the identity of brain-structure irrespective of all racial differences. This explains the analogy, sometimes even identity, between various myth-motifs, and symbols, and the possibility of human beings making themselves mutually understood. The various lines of psychic development start from one common stock whose roots reach back into all the strata of the past. This also explains the psychological parallelisms with animals.</p>
<p>Taken purely psychologically, it means that mankind has common instincts of<br>imagination and of action. All conscious imagination and action have been developed with these unconscious archetypal images as their basis, and always remain bound up with them. This condition ensures a primitive health of the psyche, which, however, immediately becomes lack of adaptation as soon as circumstances arise calling for a higher moral effort. Instincts suffice only for the individual embedded in nature, which, on the whole, remains always the same. An individual who is more guided by unconscious than by conscious choice tends therefore towards marked psychic conservatism. This is the reason the primitive does not change in the course of thousands of years, and it is also the reason why he fears everything strange and unusual. </p>
<p>Carl Jung (From Commentary on the Secret of the Golden Flower.)</p>


<p>“If it be true that there can be no metaphysics transcending human reason, it is no less true that there can be no empirical knowledge that is not already caught and limited by the a priori structure of cognition.”<br>― C.G. Jung, The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious</p>

<p>“Authors also create lovable, friendly characters, then proceed to do terrible things to them, like throw them in unsightly librarian-controlled dungeons. This makes readers feel hurt and worried for the characters. The simple truth is that authors like making people squirm. If this weren’t the case, all novels would be filled completely with cute bunnies having birthday parties.”<br>― Brandon Sanderson, Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians</p>


<p>“Every man is a hero of his own story.”<br>― Brandon Sanderson, Warbreaker</p>


<p>Watts</p>


<p>“You may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain. Remember, first, that He isn’t really doing this to anyone but Himself. </p>
<p>Remember, too, that in almost all the stories you enjoy there have to be bad people as well as good people, for the thrill of the tale is to find out how the good people will get the better of the bad. </p>
<p>It’s the same as when we play cards. At the beginning of the game we shuffle them all into a mess, which is like the bad things in the world, but the point of the game is to put the mess into good order, and the one who does it best is the winner. Then we shuffle the cards once more and play again, and so it goes with the world.”</p>
<p>Alan Watts, What to tell children about God</p>


<p>“There can be Eichmans and Himmlers and Hitlers just because there are people who unconscious of their own dark sides, and they project that darkness outward into say Jews or Communists or whatever the enemy may be, and say: ‘There is the darkness. It is not in me. And therefore, because the darkness is not in me, I am justified….But to the degree that a person becomes conscious that the darkness is in himself as much as in the other, to this same degree he is not likely to project it onto some scapegoat and commit the most criminal acts of violence upon other people.”</p>

<p>What can you do against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?</p>
<p>George Orwell</p>


<p>“The unconscious is exactly what it sounds like: It’s the stuff you don’t, won’t and/or can’t think about. According to Freud, there are dirty pictures of your mother down there. According to Jung, there are pipes, wires, even tunnels down there that connect your home to others. And even though it contains life-sustaining energies (like the fuse box and water heater), it’s a primitive, stinky, scary place and it’s no wonder that, given the choice, we don’t hang out down there.</p>
<p>However, your pleasure, your sanity and even your life depend on occasional round trips. You’ve got to change the fuses, grab the Christmas ornaments, clean the litter box. To the extent that we keep the basement door sealed, the entire home becomes unstable. The creatures downstairs get louder and the guy upstairs (your ego) tries to cover the noise with neurotic behavior. For some, eventually, the basement door can come right off its hinges and the slimy, primal denizens of the deep can become Scrabble partners. You might call this a nervous breakdown or psychotic break, it doesn’t matter. The point is: Occasional ventures by the ego into the unconscious, through therapy, meditation, confession, sex, violence, or a good story, keep the consciousness in working order.”</p>

<p>“I do so love my witches and wicked queens. I find myself drawn to feminine archetypes that previous generations have found threatening or dangerous: crones, oracles, madwomen, Amazons, virgins who aren’t helpless, bad mothers. I love to give the vagina dentata voice. It so rarely gets to speak for itself.”<br>Author: Catherynne M. Valente</p>
